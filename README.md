# task-tracker

A simple task tracker built with FastAPI.

## Quick Start Guide

Clone this repository and run `app.py` using Python >= 3.12

Visit [insert github pages url here] to access the task-tracker frontend. The webpage will attempt to communicate with localhost:8080 to access the API and its local database that is created automatically when first running `app.py`.

Alternatively, you can host the frontend on your own, for which you can find all the code in the `gh-pages` branch.

## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome! Consider creating issues for new features or bug fixes, and pull requests if you wish to improve the code directly.
